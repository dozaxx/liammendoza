                                Welcome to my website, a portfolio I built using skills I've learnt in University and a  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Udemy Online Course</a>.
                                I am a Bachelor of Science graduate, with a double major in Information Systems and Computer Sciences from the University of Auckland. 
                                I am passionate about customer service, and offer an outlook on both the technical and business side of things, 
                                helping me strategise solutions to problems I am exposed to. Other projects that I have worked on include the Microsoft Student Accelerator and
                                several University projects that deal with Analysis and Development.

                                Born in the Philippines, I came to New Zealand at the age of 8.  Growing up, I was always a keen problem solver and loved to design and build things.
                                As soon as I wrote my the first "Hello World" in Python, I instantly attracted to the idea of being able to make my ideas come to a reality. 
                                My interest for UX and UI came about because my love for design, and what better way to align this with my love for creating user interfaces.
                                In the past 3 years, I have developed a broad range of skills through university and upskilling,
                                ranging from Business Intelligence, to Networks, to Cyber Security.  During my last semester, I was a marker and teaching assistant for papers covering 
                                Human-Computer Interaction (which teaches UX), and Software Fundamentals.

                                Hobbies and interests outside of my studies include Football, Fashion and Food. I am passionate about football. I have been playing for my boyhood club,
                                Fencibles United AFC, and have so since our move to New Zealand in 08'.  I currently play for the Mens First Team, and have previously 
                                captained our Mens Reserves and Under 19s teams. As well as playing, I offer my services to the club by coaching youth and junior players in holiday programmes.
